/**
 * An alternative implementation of [[java.lang.ThreadLocal]] that lives completely in our plugin's class loader.
 * For use anywhere you would use a platform `ThreadLocal`.
 *
 * The idea is, when the Scala plugin is unloaded from IntelliJ IDEA, all references to thread local values
 * that hold instances of classes originating from the Scala plugin can be garbage collected.
 *
 * After closely examining and discussing the implementation of [[java.lang.ThreadLocal]], we have determined
 * that there is a risk of our classes still being reachable after unloading, if instances of classes of the
 * Scala plugin are kept in platform thread local values. This is because the platform thread local hash tables
 * that hold references to values use strong references to the values. Additionally, threads in IntelliJ IDEA
 * are pooled. This means that the threads will outlive our unloaded plugin and still keep strong references to
 * instances of classes from the Scala plugin.
 *
 * @note `null` values cannot be stored in this thread local, because the underlying map does not support them.
